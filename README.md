# wordle-pattern-maker

For a set of target Wordle patterns, tries to give a sequence of words that fits the target.

For example:

```
XXXXX -> wizzo
XYXGG -> tawse
GGGGG -> amuse
```

Unfortunately, due to the limited wordlist, not all patterns are possible.

Wordlist obtained via https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list, under MIT. (Thanks!)
